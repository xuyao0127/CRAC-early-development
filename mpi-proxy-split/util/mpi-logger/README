# MPI-LOGGER
The purpose of mpi-logger is to intercept MPI calls from a native program
without involving running MANA.</br>
In situations where the MPI application is close to deterministic
(e.g., one rank, or multiple ranks communicating in a deterministic pattern),
this tool helps find where the calls to MPI functions in MANA don't reflect
the correct semantics.</br>

## To build MPI-Logger
To build, go to ./mpi-proxy-split/util/mpi-logger and run `make`

## To use MPI-Logger
To run, use LD_PRELOAD to preload the generated .so file before you run.
```
Loaded with environment variables.

srun <srun arguments> env LD_PRELOAD=$PATH_TO_FILE/liblogger.so <user program>
```

## To edit MPI-Logger
To edit which MPI calls areintercepted or what content (e.g., which arguments) 
gets printed, edit ./mpi-proxy-split/util/mpi-logger/mpi_logger.cpp.
